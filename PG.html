	<h1 style="font-size: 46px; color: #navy;>"> Quick question.<br>
	Do you know where the quick steak is?</h1>
	<p style="font-size: 25PX; color: #8A5235;>"> It does not look good.<br>
	 It comes as a frozen sheet.<br>
	 A reputable source, my roommate, speculates that it is hitchhiker. Not roadkill.<br><br>

	 It does need to be at least room tempperature!!! Some people, my brother, think you can eat it brick form. <br>

	 However, it is delicious and quickly heats.<br>
	 I recently found it at the end of an aisle at another store or street???<br><br>

	 YOU KNOW WHAT I'M EXPLANING TO YOU IS?<br><br>

	 Please, make my words make sense and point me in the  correct direction.<br><br>

	 Thank you.<br><br>

	 Paper please.<br><br>
